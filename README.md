This was a talk presented by [Damjan Vukcevic](http://damjan.vukcevic.net/) on
21 February 2018 at the [Research Bazaar 2018][resbaz2018] at the University of
Melbourne.

The slides from the talk are hosted at:
<https://dvukcevic.github.io/rpkgs-talk-resbaz2018/>

The example R package shown in the talk is available from GitHub:
[mypackage][mypackage].

If you wish to build your own version of the slides, you will first need to
install [mypackage][mypackage], as well as [slidify][slidify] and its
dependencies.

[mypackage]: https://github.com/dvukcevic/mypackage
[slidify]: https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify

Example solutions to the challenge problems (which are presented on the final
slide) are included in this repo in the `challenge-solutions` directory.

This talk is based on a previous, longer and more detailed talk given by Damjan
Vukcevic, which is also available via GitHub: [rpkgs-talk][rpkgs-talk]
